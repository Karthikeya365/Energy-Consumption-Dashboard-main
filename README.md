# Energy-Consumption-Dashboard-main
Project Overview:
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize energy consumption across various systems and devices. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and dashboard creation to provide actionable insights for optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs.

Steps Involved in the Project:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathered raw data from the company's database and processed it using Python.
Applied data cleaning and feature engineering techniques to ensure the dataset was structured for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted statistical analysis and created visualizations using Python to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in energy consumption.
3. Exporting Data to Power BI:
Transformed and exported the processed data along with EDA insights into a structured format (CSV) for seamless integration into Power BI.
4. Dashboard Creation:
Designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring tables, charts, and graphs to represent key insights effectively.
Leveraged Power BI’s drag-and-drop interface for intuitive data visualization.
5. Publishing and Sharing:
Deployed the dashboard to the Power BI service, making it accessible to stakeholders through the Power BI app and web portal.
Key Learnings & Features:
